          <h3>What is Into</h3>
          <p>Into pulls data from all your favorite media streaming services like Spotify, Netflix, Steam, and Audible and examines what you've been streaming the most over the past 7 days. As a user of Into, you can generate a 3x3 image of album covers, book covers, movie posters, and any other visual representation of everything you've been streaming over the past 7 days.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Why should I use into?</h3>
          <p>Into was originally created as a fun way to share your most recent interest in an easy-to-consume visual format. After a user generates a new collage, that user can download it or share it through Instagram, Twitter, Tinder, and more, opening the door to quick conversation starters.</p>

          <h3>How does Into work?</h3>
          <p>Currently, a users can sign up then sign in using real or fake credentials, or users can use these provided example credentials to Login:</p>
          <p><code>u: into@example.com</code>
          <br>
          <code>p: into</code></p>
          <p>When a user successfully signs in, that user can change their password (please do not edit the example account password) or sign out. A signed-in user will also see the "Accounts" page in the navigation bar. When a user visits the Accounts page, that user can pick and choose which streaming services they wish to connect, such as Spotify. Into will save the account information of that service so when you press the "generate a collage" button, Into will look at the authenticated streaming services in your account and pull recent data to generate a collage by.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>What's next for Into?</h3>
          <p>Into is still in its infancy right now and new challenges are being tackled everyday. Most recently, Into connects with Spotify's Web API, which is a huge success for the app because this is a scalable Proof of Concept and can be applied to other Web API's such as Netflix or Steam. As new streaming services are connected, the manual input will be depricated, and the JS engine will be built utilizing real data, and finally the social sharing platform will be built to complete the "collage life cycle".</p>
